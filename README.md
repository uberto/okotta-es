# How to Build and Run

* Make sure you have a java jdk installed, version 8 or later
* Get the code from github `git clone https://github.com/uberto/okotta-es.git`
* Build using gradle wrapper (this will auto-download gradle and all dependencies) e.g.

```
cd <directory-where-code-has-been-checked-out-from-git>
./gradlew clean build
```

(this will fail because of the broken tests for exercises)

* To Run the helpdesk example web-application:

```
./gradlew :example-ticketing:run
```
